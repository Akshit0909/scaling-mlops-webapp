# Customer Churn Prediction Frontend

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction Frontend repository! This repository contains the frontend code for interacting with the customer churn prediction system. This README provides an overview of the project structure, components, flow, and key learnings.

## Overview

This project aims to provide users with an intuitive web interface for submitting customer information and receiving churn prediction results from the deployed machine learning model. The frontend is built using React.js, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Project Structure

### Components
- **App.js**: Main entry point of the application. Renders child components and manages overall structure.
- **MyComponent.js**: Handles user interaction, form submission, and result display.
- **ProjectInfo.js**: Displays project information and details.

### CSS
- **MyComponent.css**: Stylesheet for MyComponent.js.
- **App.css**: Main stylesheet for styling the application.

## Flow Overview

1. **App.js - Entry Point**: Renders the main structure of the application, including ProjectInfo and MyComponent.
2. **MyComponent.js - Form Handling**: Manages form submission, user input handling, and result display.
3. **ProjectInfo.js - Project Information**: Displays project details and information.

## Detailed Flow

Refer to the provided detailed flow documentation for a comprehensive understanding of the component interaction, state management, and user flow within the application.

## Additional Notes and Learnings

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
To ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, CORS must be configured appropriately. This prevents CORS-related errors and allows seamless data exchange between the client and server.

### Asynchronous Programming with Async/Await
Utilize asynchronous programming techniques, such as async/await, to handle HTTP requests efficiently. This ensures that the user interface remains responsive while waiting for server responses. Asynchronous code execution enables concurrent tasks, improving overall application performance.

### Debugging and Error Handling
When encountering errors, utilize debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues effectively. Proper error handling, including try-catch blocks, ensures graceful handling of errors and prevents application crashes. Debugging tools and logging mechanisms aid in diagnosing and troubleshooting issues during development and deployment.

## Next Steps

If you encounter any issues or errors, refer to the provided documentation and debug accordingly. Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend to enable accurate prediction results.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
